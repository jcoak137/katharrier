            <h1>Guide to Katarina Harrier Stance</h1>
            <p>This is a complete overview of Katarina's options out of her stance, Harrier (F+4)</p>
        </div>


        <div>
        <h2>Moves out of Harrier</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Har 1: i12 Fastest option, gives massive damage on CH, -3 on block</li>
            <li>Har 4: Fastest mid, wall bounces, safe on block</li>
            <li>Har 3: Low sweep that knockdowns on hit, -25 on block</li>
            <li>Har DF3: Faster low poke, +5 on hit and -12 on block</li>
            <li>Har UF3: Mid with similar animation to HAR 3, knocksdown on hit and combos on CH, -9 on block </li>
            <li>Har DF2,3: Mid high string</li>
            <li>Har 2: Mid poke nothing special won't really see it used. </li>
            <li>HAR 1+2: Rage drive basically HAR 2 but more damage</li>
            <li>Har DF1+2: Her command grab df1+2 but from harrier</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Move with Harrier Transitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>B1</li>
            <li>D2</li>
            <li>Df1,1</li>
            <li>1,1</li>
            <li>3,3,3</li>
            <li>4,4,4</li>
            <li>WS1,1</li>
            <li>WS3,3,3</li>
            <li>UF4,4,4,4</li>
        </ul>
        </div>


        <div>
        <h2>Understanding the Frame data on HAR transitions</h2>
        
        <h3>Multi-hit Transitions on block</h3>
        <p>Multi-hit transitions are all going to be -1 ob and the fastest move out of Harrier is only i12 (HAR 1). This means that all these transitions can be covered by an i12 mid.</p>
        <p>Not only that but DF1,1 and WS1,1 are both second hit highs without any mids to mix you up so you can always duck when you see these moves. </p>
        <p>HAR 1 has high crush frames so thats why it needs to be an i12 mid, a quick move that high crushes also works but be careful.</p>
        
        <h3>B1 and D2 on block</h3>
        <p>Both these are mids +3 on block going into Harrier. This means HAR1 can only be interrupted with a high crush but her other options can cover that.</p>
        <p>B1 also has two regular extensions that are both mids so be mindful of those when you are choosing to mash against B1. </p>

        <h3>Transitions on hit</h3>
        <p>Slightly different frames on a couple transitions, usually around +10 and 1,1 is the lowest plus frames at +5.</p>
        <p>Either way you are holding the mix on hit and you can't step out safely.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Gameplan</h2>
        <p>The main goal is minimizing the risk of being CH by HAR1 and avoiding taking the mixup between HAR 3, HAR DF3, and HAR UF3. Only other move to really be aware of is HAR 4 when near the wall.</p>
        <p>HAR 1 CH damage is nasty and we can avoid a lot of mixup situations if we are aware of the frame data. </p>

        <h3>On Block</h3>
        <p>Use i12 mid on multi-hit transitions</p>
        <p>Quick SSR - Will evade the slower options and blocks HAR 1</p>
        <p>SSR Duck - Ducks the HAR 1 but opens you up to getting hit by HAR DF2,3</p>
        <p>Additional note on DF2,3: Isn't that scary to get hit by so risking the duck isn't that bad. Just doing a quick SSR will allow you to block the DF2,3 and then you can launch it</p>
        <p>FOR FEMALES: You can just SSR and the HAR 1 whiffs so shoutout Gender Equality.</p>

        <h3>On Hit</h3>
        <p>As mentioned earlier: Hold the mix or try seeing if you can react to the slower options</p>
        <p>SSR on a read if they are going for the slower options</p>
        <p>Careful at the wall when trying to step since HAR 4 will catch stepping and wall bounce.</p>
